## Eversense CGM: Getting Started

### Sensor Insertion (Done by Your Doctor)
1. Visit your trained healthcare provider for the procedure. Only physicians who have completed the Eversense CGM Insertion and Removal Training Program may perform the insertion.
2. The tiny sensor is placed just under the skin of your upper arm via a small incision, closed with Steri-Strips — usually no stitches required.

### Incision Care (First Few Days)
3. Avoid strenuous activities that may pull at the incision or cause heavy sweating while it heals. Remove the Steri-Strips within a few days.

### Warm-Up Phase
4. After insertion, the official Eversense app will show "Warm Up Phase." The sensor must complete this period before calibration is accepted. Do not attempt to calibrate during this phase.
5. Once the warm-up is complete, proceed to set up the AAPS plugin.

### Transmitter & AAPS Setup
6. Open the official Eversense app, go to Connections, tap your transmitter, and select Disconnect.
7. In AAPS, go to Config Builder and select Eversense as your BG source.
8. Open the Eversense plugin settings and enter your Eversense DMS account credentials (username and password). Both the E3 and E365 require credentials to authenticate with the Eversense cloud and retrieve your transmitter's security certificate at every new connection.
9. Tap Scan to find your transmitter and pair it via Bluetooth.

## Eversense Plugin Settings — Functions Explained

### Credentials
Enter your Eversense DMS account username and password. Both the E3 and E365 require credentials to authenticate with the Eversense cloud and retrieve your transmitter's security certificate at every new connection.

### Calibration
Displays your current calibration phase, the date of your last calibration, and when your next calibration is due. When the transmitter is ready, the Calibrate button becomes active — tap it, enter your fingerstick reading, and the value is sent directly to the transmitter over Bluetooth. Calibration is not accepted during the warm-up or initialization phase.

### Transmitter Placement Signal
Shows real-time signal strength between the transmitter and the sensor. Signal levels are:
- Excellent (>=75)
- Good (48-74)
- Low (30-47)
- Poor (25-29)
- Very Poor (1-24)

If the signal is poor for 3 or more consecutive readings, you will receive an urgent notification. Tap it to open the placement guide.

### Notifications & Alerts
The plugin provides the following system notifications:
- Transmitter not placed — urgent alert with a link to the placement guide.
- Firmware version — shown once per firmware version, prompting you to check for updates in the official Eversense app.
- Transmitter alarms — high/low glucose and other transmitter alerts are relayed as AAPS notifications.

### DMS Portal Sync
After every glucose reading, the plugin automatically uploads your data to the Eversense DMS web portal so your care team can view it in real time. Each sync uploads your latest glucose value, trend, signal strength, and battery level; your glucose history; and device diagnostic logs.

## Daily Use

10. Apply a fresh adhesive patch each morning and wear the transmitter over the sensor site on your upper arm.
11. Charge the transmitter daily — no glucose data is collected while it is charging.
12. Check AAPS for your glucose reading, trend arrows, and alerts.
13. Monitor placement signal in the plugin settings if readings seem inconsistent.
14. Calibrate when due — tap the Calibrate button and enter your fingerstick reading. Always do a fingerstick check if symptoms do not match your CGM reading.
15. If you need to switch back to the official Eversense app temporarily (e.g. to update firmware), go to AAPS Settings -> CGM and delete the CGM source, then reconnect in the official app.
